                    Tokyo Manji Gang 2nd Generation was led by Manjiro Sano (a.k.a. Mikey).<br/>
                    Mikey is a teenager of below average height with pitch black piercing eyes and <br/>long blond hair that is only tied at the top with the hair on the sides moving freely.
                    <br/>Mikey formed Toman with 5 of his closest friends:
                    Ruguji Ken, Keisuke Baji, Hanemiya Kazutora, Mitsuya Takashi, Haruki Hayashida (Pah-Chin).
                    <br/>By the time Toman was completely formed, it had 5 Divisions.
                    <br/>1st Division Captain Seishuu.
                    <br/>2nd Division Captain Mitsuya Takashi with Hakkai Shiba as his vice Captain.
                    <br/>3rd Division Captain Pah-Chin with Peh-Yan as his vice Captain.
                    <br/>4th Division Captain Smiley with Angry as his vice Captain.
                    <br/>5th Division Captain kawaragi Senju.
                    <br/>Lastly, President Mikey and Vice-President Chifuyu.
                    <br/>Eventually as Toman grew, it became a criminal organization and Mikey had fallen from grace.
