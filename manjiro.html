                    Tokyo Manji Gang 1st Generation was led by Manjiro Sano (a.k.a. Mikey).<br/>
                    Mikey wanted to create a new era of delinquents, just like his late brother, Sano Shinichiro did.
                    <br/>Mikey formed Toman with 5 of his closest friends:
                    Ruguji Ken, Keisuke Baji, Hanemiya Kazutora, Mitsuya Takashi, Haruki Hayashida (Pah-Chin).
                    <br/>By the time Toman was completely formed, it had 5 Divisions.
                    <br/>1st Division Captain Keisuke Baji with Chifuyu Matsuno as his vice Captain.
                    <br/>2nd Division Captain Mitsuya Takashi with Hakkai Shiba as his vice Captain.
                    <br/>3rd Division Captain Pah-Chin with Peh-Yan as his vice Captain.
                    <br/>4th Division Captain Smiley with Angry as his vice Captain.
                    <br/>5th Division Captain Muto Yusuhiro with Haruchiyo Sanzu as his vice Captain.
                    <br/>Lastly, Commander Mikey and Vice-Commander Draken.
                    <br/>Eventually as Toman grew, it became a criminal organization and Mikey had fallen from grace.
